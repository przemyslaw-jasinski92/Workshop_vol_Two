# Workshop vol. Two
Next workshop on course Coderslab - DAO.\n
I created program, which helps user to modify database from IDE:
- DbUtli (for creating connection to database in MySQL)
- User (keeping data for each row from database)
- UserDao (excluding all methods needs to add new object to database, edit or deleting existing and getting all objects from database to User array)
